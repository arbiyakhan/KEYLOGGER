Keyloggers, also known as keystroke loggers, are software tools designed to capture and 
record keystrokes made on a computer keyboard covertly. They have legitimate uses in 
monitoring user activity for security, parental control, or system administration purposes. 
However, they also pose significant ethical and security concerns when used without 
authorization. This project focuses on the development of a keylogger implemented in 
Python. The keylogger captures keystrokes and monitors active window titles, logging this 
data to a file along with timestamps. Periodically, the logged data is emailed  to a specified 
address, allowing remote monitoring of user activity. The implementation leverages 
Python's libraries such as ‘pynput’ for keyboard monitoring and ‘pygetwindow’ for active 
window detection.
